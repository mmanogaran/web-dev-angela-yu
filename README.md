### [Personal Website - HTML](https://mmanogaran.github.io/web-dev-angela-yu/01-personal-site-html/index.html)

#### Modifications
- Included use of semantic HTML

A website where you can use your mouse or keyboard to emulate playing the drums.

#### Modifications
- Used `forEach` instead of loop to add an `EventListener` to all drums
- Used `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`, `keyDown`, and `keyUp` instead of `click`, `keyDown`, and `setTimeout` to play sounds and handle animations
